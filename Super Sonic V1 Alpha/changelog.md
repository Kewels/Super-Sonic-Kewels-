## Super/Hyper Sonic Faithful 2.0
-Added Hyper Sonic over Super Sonic proper.

-Super Sonic now has a boost trail regardless of having max rings.

-Reverted a few animation back to vanilla.

-Re-imported models and remapped materials to add support for mixing Super Sonic mods over Super Sonic proper.

-Adjusted flight speed and height.

-Added Super physics to Cyberspace and 2D open world.  These still need tweaking to be fully playable.

-Fixed the recovery smash animation by reverting it back to OG and using the correct asm file for Sonic's jump ball.

-Super Sonic now uses more custom colors due to limitations with porting over effects as to not conflict with Hyper Sonic.  Some of these are still a WIP and will be fine tuned later.

-Other stuff I might've forgot about.
