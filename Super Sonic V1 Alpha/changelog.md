## Super/Hyper Sonic Truly Faithful 3.0
- A Cheat Engine script to transform into the real Super/Hyper Sonic is now included.  Read transform-readme.txt for controls and details.

- The colorful aura for Hyper Sonic has been updated.  There is also a new star aura for Hyper Sonic.

- Added A LOT of custom animations.

- Quills now move for most models.  Any don't don't move have clipping issues that I plan on sorting out later.

- Overall updated visuals for Super and Hyper Sonic.  All models have an outline aura and base form Super Sonic now has an aura when the Phantom Rush is enabled.

- Physics and combat has been completely revamped.  Special moves are now overall quicker for both Super and Hyper Sonic.  Hyper Sonic's speed has also been increased a bit.

- Eye customization is now possible within HMM, so no more running a batch script to change Hyper Sonic's eye color.

- I implemented some HMM codes to help enhance gameplay.  These codes can also be turned off entirely if you prefer.

- Flying no longer has a pre-determined horizontal and vertical speed.  Flight speed is now determined based on your air momentum while moving through the air.

- Cyberspace stages should now feel better and be much more playable.

- Rail grinding is now faster in order to compliment the updated flight.

- Base Sonic and Super Sonic have been added back into Faithful.  This also depreciates Hyper Sonic Faithful standalone, which will no longer be updated.

- Improved Cyberspace physics.  These stages should be more fun to play now.

- Super Sonic is now invincible.

- Super Sonic can now attract rings.

## Super/Hyper Sonic Faithful 2.6.9-rev5
- Fixes an oversight that made the cyloop color blue when custom physics are turned off.  Thank you Sandpie for pointing this out! :)

## Super/Hyper Sonic Faithful 2.6.9-rev4
- Fixes yet another porting problem for 1.20.  Hyper Sonic's cyloop color is now white instead of being invisible.

## Super/Hyper Sonic Faithful 2.6.9-rev3
- Adds an option to turn off Cyber Space custom physics.  This will also disable 2D open world physics.

## Super/Hyper Sonic Faithful 2.6.9-rev2
- Adds support for version 1.20 of Frontiers.

## Super/Hyper Sonic Faithful 2.6.8AP
- The Soap Shoes problem while using the Adventure quills has been fixed correctly now.  Sorry about that! :)

## Super/Hyper Sonic Faithful 2.6.7AP
- Added some missing files to the update server.  These should hopefully fix an issue with the Adventure quills not working with the Soap shoes, but currently, this needs verification.

## Super/Hyper Sonic Faithful 2.6.6 Hotfix
- Fixed a bug with the eye texture swapping batch file that breaks compatibility on some computers.

## Super/Hyper Sonic Faithful 2.6.5
- Fixed eyes on all 17(?) models.  Previously, the eyes would not move due to incorrect names being used.

- Aura outline added to Hyper Sonic.

- The colorful aura has been adjusted to be consistent between each fight, representative of the Giganto and Supreme boss fights.

- Support for eye customization has been added for Hyper Sonic.  The available colors are cyan, magenta, blue and red.  To change eye colors, open the run_to_change_eye_colors.bat batch file and follow the prompt on-screen.

- File size has been reduced due to a ton of duplicate files being included in the last release.  This was due to some unknowns during that time and these files are no longer needed.  Files that are not needed in some .pac files have also been deleted.  There's still room for space to be saved in the future.

- Grinding animations for all models have been reverted back to vanilla.  This was orignially changed due to the broken nature of early released.  Since the broken animations are no longer an issue, the flying animation band-aid is no longer needed.

## 2.6
