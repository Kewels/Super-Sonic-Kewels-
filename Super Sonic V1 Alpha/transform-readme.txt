Credits to Sacatur for the Cheat Engine script.  I made modifications to it to improve usability.

To transform into Super/Hyper Sonic. you need Cheat Engine.  This can be easily found on Google (or your preferred search engine).

Once installed, open the file "Transformation.CT".  Cheat Engine should open.

In the top left of the program, click on the icon that has a computer monitor and a magnifying glass on it.  Search Sonic Frontiers on the list, select it, then hit open.



From there, you can use the folowing controls on a controller:

Left trigger + Y to transform.
Left stick click to fly up and right stick click to fly down.
RT+A will force your vertical speed to 0.
To increase or decrease your ring count by 5, press up or down on the dpad, up to increase, down to decrease.
To increase or decrease your ring count by 50, hold B button and press up/down to increase/decrease.

Keyboard controls:

Keypad 5 on your keypad to transform
Page up to fly up and page down to fly down.
The Home key will reset your vertical speed to 0.
To increase or decrease your ring count by 5, press the + key on your keypad, - to decrease.
To increase or decrease your ring count by 50, hold L shift key and press keypad +/- to increase/decrease.

There is currectly no way to revert back to Sonic's base form.  To revert, you need to reload the map.
