Title="Super/Hyper Sonic Ultimate"
Version="Hyper Sonic Combat Update rev 1"
Description="It's been awhile, huh?\n\nThis mod allows you to freely choose between Super and Hyper Sonic across base, Super, and the Super Sonic 2 transformation!  This update features a true color changing Hyper Sonic, an updated transformation method, new flight controls for base form Super/Hyper Sonic and more.  You can also explore from the ground at blazing fast speeds, with overhauled physics and improved combat and super attacks!\n\nFor anyone wondering, yes, this mod will work perfectly fine with Sora's Super Sonic mod if you wanna use it for Hyper Sonic. However, if you wish to take advantage of the new features, I recommend at least trying the included transformation script or using the tool provided in a separate download.  If you still wish to use Sora's Super Sonic mod and you also want the new features included in this update, you will need to remap some controls in Sora's mod under the config options.  In this case, contact me on Discord if you have trouble, as Sora has no involvement with the setup I have included here.\n\nHighlights:\n-Super/Hyper transformations\n-Alternate costumes\n-Transformation script\n-Spindash support\n-Custom physics\n-Custom animations\n-Multiple auras to choose from for Hyper Sonic\n-Customizable eye colors for Hyper Sonic\n-Other stuff I might've forgot about\n- *NEW* Color changing Hyper Sonic\n- *NEW* Hyper Sonic playable in open zone\n- *NEW* Super/Hyper Sonic 2 transformation\n- *NEW* Trainer for handling transformation\n- I probably forgot about other things.\n\nFlight controls for base form flight:\n________________________________\n\nRight stick click + dpad Up enables flight.  Once enabled, activate it by doing a double jump. LT defaults to air drifting.\n\nRight stick click + dpad Left restores Sonic Boom Kick on LT after enabling flight.\n\nRight stick click/Y + dpad Down restores ground movement.\n\nLeft stick click + right stick click reloads Sonic.  Only use this if things break and nothing else fixes it, as this risks crashing the game.\n\nSuper Sonic transformation script/application controls:\n_______________________________________________________\nY + dpad Up or numberpad 1: Enable Super Sonic transformation\n\nY + dpad Right or numberpad 2: Enable Super Sonic 2 transformation (may require a visit back to the title screen and reloading a save file)\n\nY + dpad Left or numberpad 3: Disable Super Sonic 2 transformation (revert to Super Sonic)\n\nY + dpad Down or numberpad 4: Disable Super Sonic transformation (revert to base)\n\nLeft stick click + A/dpad Up/Page Up: Fly Up\n\nLeft stick click + B/dpad Down/Page Down: Fly Down\n\nFlight up and down controls are base Sonic friendly.  This means that, while base form flight is enabled, actions such as stomping will be disabled until base form flight is turned off.\n\nIf you intend on using anything from this mod for anything that you plan on posting online, please contact me first and provide credit.  Modding takes a lot of time and effort, so providing proper credit is very important to me."
