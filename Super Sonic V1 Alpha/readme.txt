Flight controls for base flight:
________________________________
Right stick click + dpad Up enables flight.  Once enabled, activate it by doing a double jump. LT defaults to air drifting.
Right stick click + dpad Left restores Sonic Boom Kick on LT after enabling flight.
Right stick click/Y + dpad Down restores ground movement.
Left stick click + right stick click reloads Sonic.  Only use this if things break and nothing else fixes it, as this risks crashing the game.

Super Sonic transformation script/application controls:
_______________________________________________________
Y + dpad Up or numberpad 1: Enable Super Sonic transformation
Y + dpad Right or numberpad 2: Enable Super Sonic 2 transformation (may require a visit back to the title screen and reloading a save file)
Y + dpad Left or numberpad 3: Disable Super Sonic 2 transformation (revert to Super Sonic)
Y + dpad Down or numberpad 4: Disable Super Sonic transformation (revert to base)

Left stick click + A/dpad Up/Page Up: Fly Up
Left stick click + B/dpad Down/Page Down: Fly Down

Flight up and down controls are base Sonic friendly.  This means that, while base form flight is enabled, actions such as stomping will be disabled until base form flight is turned off.
