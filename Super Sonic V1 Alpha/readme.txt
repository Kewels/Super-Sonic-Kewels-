Flight controls for base flight:(BROKEN, research needed) 
________________________________
Hold parry and click left stick in.
Left stick and right stick click restores ground movement. You can also stomp out of flight.
Left stick click + right stick click reloads Sonic.  Only use this if things break and nothing else fixes it, as this risks crashing the game.

Super Sonic transformation script/application controls: (Script update needed)
_______________________________________________________
Y + dpad Up or numberpad 1: Enable Super Sonic transformation
Y + dpad Right or numberpad 2: Enable Super Sonic 2 transformation (may require a visit back to the title screen and reloading a save file)
Y + dpad Left or numberpad 3: Disable Super Sonic 2 transformation (revert to Super Sonic)
Y + dpad Down or numberpad 4: Disable Super Sonic transformation (revert to base)

Left stick click + A/dpad Up/Page Up: Fly Up
Left stick click + B/dpad Down/Page Down: Fly Down

Flight up and down controls are base Sonic friendly.  This means that, while base form flight is enabled, actions such as stomping will be disabled until base form flight is turned off. (subject to change)

New features:
_____________________________________
Movement/Particle trails can now be selected.

In addition to being invulnerable to damage in the open zone forms, Super/Hyper Sonic will now damage anything he comes into contact with.

The Hyper Flash attack has been added.  After jumping as Hyper Sonic, jump again to launch forward and instakill any nearby enemies, instantly KOing guardians and dealing heavy damage to Titans.
*The Hyper Flash move can be customized with fadeout and explosive visuals variants.  The flash is also disabled in Cyberspace and some game modes dur to crashing concerns.  Hyper Flash can also be used in a transformed state by holding parry and pressing the Y button.

The Super Stomp has been re-added and tweaked by me to occur when you stomp from any height.  It is now called the Super/Hyper Stomp.  It deals damage to nearby enemies upon contact with the ground.

The Spin Dash has been upgraded to the Super/Hyper Spin Dash.  This adds sparks to the animation and increases your hitbox during a Spin Boost.

Chaos Meteor is an original move made by me.  While transformed into a Hyper state (boss forms only), hold parry and press X.  Anything within a small nearby radius will get hit and deal massive damage.  Release the X button to perform a Chaos Blast as a follow-up.  Press X rapidly while holding parry to charge it up, which will allow you to move around freely while in the Chaos Meteor state for a brief time.  The extended hitbox radius will still be active during this state.  Alternatively, hold X to hold the charge.

Diving out of a fall animation is now possible by pressing Y when falling.  You can also stomp and dash out of a dive.  This can be done anywhere.

Explosive Boost is just visual flare for now when holding the boost button at a standstill.  Subject to change in the future.

I'm probably forgetting things.
